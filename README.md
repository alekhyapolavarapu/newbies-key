##Overview
It's always a tough job for any individual to move out of their location and to get a place to live in the new location. So here we are with an idea to create an application that will be useful to all the people entering a new city. An Apartment search android application which is a simple yet pretty handy for a bunch of newbie's entering a city.

We have these included in our Application

1)Login Page with complete validations

2)Registration Page with complete validations

3)Home Page with 2 Options
  
  -----a) Search near your current location
  
  -----b) Search by your desired city

4)Results are then shown in 2 ways
  
  -----a) Map View
  
  -----b) List View

5)Clicking on any result takes you to the Owner's Details page

6)Chat with the Owner feature

7)Calling the owner directly from the application

8)A Seekbar with an advantage of switching between the pages


###The final feature we have implemented a Seekbar in a way that the user can switch between screens instantly like he can move from a final screen to the 1st screen in just one drag.
